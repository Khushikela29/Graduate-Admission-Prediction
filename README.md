# Graduate-Admission-Prediction
Graduate Admission Prediction using Machine Learning
It is often seen that students coming from samll cities find it difficult to choose the college for their graduation and hence leading to waste their future. What if we come up with idea of letting students know if they are eligible for college or not. This will definitely help them to select college on the basis of their marks scored. This project aims to revolutionize the graduate the admission process for students.
The project is implemented through several ML algorithms, including - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), K Nearest Neighbour Classifier (KNN), Random Forest Classifier.
To run the project you can either download the zip file of the project or fork the repository.
